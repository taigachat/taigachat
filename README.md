## What is TaigaChat?
TaigaChat is a decentralized chat-client. Anyone should be able to self-host their
own server. And the standard should not be dependent on any central service. Any
centralized service in TaigaChat is there purely for the convinience of those
that are less concious about their online presence.

TaigaChat in its current state has (a):
1. Voice Calls
2. Chat Rooms
3. Web Client
4. Push to Talk
5. S3 Attachments
6. Update Button
7. Server Profile Synchronization
8. Role-based Permissions System
9. Cryptographic Offline Login
10. Hosted Servers

## Contributing
If you have an idea for a feature or improvement, please create an issue
and discuss it first. In most cases, I would prefer to implement the feature
myself. However, I do not wish to discourage people from playing around with
the code - to the contrary, I would feel honoured if someone did.
